# so you are just taking the last digit of the number given 
# _lastDigit = num%10

# then you are placing this last digit from the starting in reverse order in rev variable using 
# rev = rev*10 + _lastDigit

# after that you are reducing the original number by 10

# then after you have reversed the number, you are checking the original number with the reversed number 
# if (rev == a):
#         return True
#     return False

# if they are equal you return true that is that the number is a palindrome otherwise it is not
